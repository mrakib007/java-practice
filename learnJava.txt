Every java code starts running from it's main function. That is the starting point for any java code.

//////
System.out.print() is the line we use for showing output in java. Here system is a class. And print is a function where we have to pass what we want to see as output. 
System.out.println() is the line we use for showing output in java. This works as println. But it shows output in the next line.

/////
data types
1byte = 8 bits
char = 2bytes
boolean = 1byte
int = 4bytes
long = 8bytes
float = 4bytes
double = 8bytes

//////
We take input in java with a class named Scanner. And here is a function called next(). We can take input from it.
If we want to print more than one word in java, we have to use nextLine() function.
nextInt() for taking int type value
nextFloat() for taking float type value as input.

/////
In do while loop, the code will be executed at least one time regardless the conditions that are given.

/////
There is a small difference between functions and methods.
We call methods from an object of a class, and we call functions directly.

/////
new is a keyword when we need to keep a new space in the memory. Means when we declare a non primitive type variable which needs space in the memory, we use new to keep space for that variable.
